# Aritificial-Intelligence-Project
Simulator for the AI Wumpus World game in C++ with Python wrapper.

Written by Larry Holder (holder@wsu.edu).

The Wumpus Simulator is a simple framework for simulating the Wumpus World described in Russell and Norvig's "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach". The simulator is written in C++, but you can design your agent in either C++ or Python. The idea is for you to modify the Agent.h and Agent.cc (or Agent.py) files to implement your super-smart agent. The C++ and Python agents provided simply accept commands from the keyboard and execute them in the simulator. The keyboard commands are 'f' for forward, 'l' for turnleft, 'r' for turnright, 'g' for grab, 's' for shoot, and 'c' for climb.
